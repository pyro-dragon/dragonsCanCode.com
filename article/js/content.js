The venue was the <a href='https://www.rafmuseum.org.uk/cosford/' title='Cosford RAF Museum'>Cosford RAF Museum</a> which was a fun drive to get to.</p><p>Two friends and I set of in a small convoy up the M5/M6 and braved the 30 mph speed restrictions on the Birmingham flyover. We arrived early, following a very obvious Briskodian into the compound and finding ourselved in the wrong car park. In a slightly larger convoy we set off to find the correct location on the second try.</p><p>There were a lot of fine looking motors there, some polished to perfection, others wearing their battle scars with pride. The highlights there were the 560bhp Skoda Supurb with the Greenline badge on the back and the 1989 Skoda Rapid with the rear mounted Rover engine conversion.</p><p>As an ameture detailer I took pride in seeing the admiering glances my motor received, especially being the only one in its colour there.</p><p>The only downside to the day was the wonderful british weather. While it was generous enough to save the rain until 3pm, the winds were wild and the tempreture took a nasty plunge. All in all though it was a great day, well run by the organisers. I even got a lovely new sticker for my rear window!</p>",

The conference was spread over two days and covered a wide range of web development, UX design and general engineering subjects. </p><p>The most interesting thing for me I feel was the talk on accessibility on the web. This is something that if very important and not given enough thought by enough people. There were some excellent points made about accessibility for those with cognitive disabilities as well as situational conditions where even an able-bodied person may not have full use of their faculties.</p>",

It uses a lot of the things I have learned in the past 12 months and will act as a base for conducting future experiments in web design, UX and other webby things (Angular 4, React maybe???). Eventually I would like to use this as a template framework for my other sites, but that is a little bit off for now.",

I hope it has made some people think about some really cool things they can introduce to their current or future projects.",
