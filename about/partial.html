    <h2><small>Hello there!</small></h2>
    <p>
        I'm <strong>Rob Pettefar</strong> and I have a <strong>passion</strong> for writing <strong>great code</strong> and designing <strong>great user experiances</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm a <strong>Software Engineer</strong> with <strong>7 years experiance</strong> in the industry.
        I specialise in <strong>Web Front End</strong> and <strong>User Interface</strong> development and design.
    </p>
    <p>
        My background has been in more general software development, starting with a <strong>BSc (Hons) Computer Games Programming</strong> undergraduate degree.
        The start of my career was in the <strong>Automated Publishing</strong> industry working on <strong>Java</strong> applications.
        That industry was rapidly embrasing online publishing and the company quickly adapted. I got my first experiance working on commercial web applications then and I discovered a passion.

        Since then, I have been hooked on web design and development!
