The conference was spread over two days and covered a wide range of web development, UX design and general engineering subjects. The most interesting thing for me I feel was the talk on accessibility on the web. This is something that if very important and not given enough thought by enough people. There were some excellent points made about accessibility for those with cognitive disabilities as well as situational conditions where even an able-bodied person may not have full use of their faculties.",

It uses a lot of the things I have learned in the past 12 months and will act as a base for conducting future experiments in web design, UX and other webby things (Angular 4, React maybe???). Eventually I would like to use this as a template framework for my other sites, but that is a little bit off for now.",

I hope it has made some people think about some really cool things they can introduce to their current or future projects.",
